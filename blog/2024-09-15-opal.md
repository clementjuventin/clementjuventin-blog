In September 2023, I was invited to lend a hand on an ambitious DeFi project built on **Ethereum** called **Opal**. What started as a casual contribution soon evolved into a **core team membership**. This is the story of how we built and launched the platform.

## Opal Explained

Opal is a **DeFi** protocol rooted in the Ethereum ecosystem, specifically leveraging [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/) and [Aura Finance](https://aura.finance/). Its core mission is to offer a simple financial system with dynamic yield-generating strategies. The centerpiece of the protocol is the **Omnipool**: a single-asset liquidity pool that dynamically distributes and rebalances liquidity across multiple pools.

Liquidity allocation is governed by a community voting mechanism, powered by the **GEM** token, which represents the protocol's decision-making authority.

Opal draws heavy inspiration from [**Conic Finance**](https://conic.finance/), which operates within the Curve ecosystem. For more on the financial mechanics, I’ll defer to the experts — I'm not the one designing the protocol financial logic, but rather the one helping make it a reality. To understand the intricacies, visit [our documentation](https://docs.opaldefi.xyz/) and appreciate this flywheel being as beautiful as it is hard to understand.

## The team

Our team consisted of four developers and two business/vision managers. We set out to build a complete protocol, production-ready and capable of handling potentially millions in value.

Though I lacked experience, I made up for it with **strong fundamentals** and **relentless motivation**. That’s how my Opal journey began — a bold, real-world challenge I was eager to take on.

## Development Journey

Over several months, we shaped the protocol and defined the requirements for the first version. I was assigned to the **Reward Manager**, a crucial module responsible for distributing rewards from the Omnipools to users. It was a tricky component, and the initial team had struggled with it, which is why I was brought on board.

To be honest, I struggled too. I’ll dive into the technical and mathematical complexity of this module in a later post.

At this stage, Opal was still a side project for everyone, so the relatively slow development pace suited us. But that was about to change.

## Fundraising: Private & Public Rounds

While development was underway, the business team was busy pitching to investors and organizing a private seed round. I wasn’t deeply involved in this phase, but word was that it went well — we secured commitments without giving up too many tokens, and **early signs from the market were encouraging**.

Our [Twitter](https://x.com/opaldefi) and Discord communities started **gaining traction**, adding pressure on the dev team to finalize the protocol.

The funds raised during the private seed were used to ramp up marketing: promo videos, contests, influencer campaigns — all in preparation for the public round.

The public raise was hosted on [Fjord Foundry](https://app.fjordfoundry.com/token-sales/0x1F272Ab2BDc512cb59e7b49485eFE16d2d7F9ffa), a platform tailored for such events. The response was phenomenal — we raised $1.58 million. I could hardly believe it myself.

## Delivering on Expectations 

With a successful raise behind us, the pressure was on. Development needed to accelerate. Looking back, this period was rough — we clearly underestimated the time required to finalize the product.

We went from working 4–6 hours a week to over 20 hours per week, all while juggling full-time jobs. We rushed through two audits, each with just five days to fix reported issues. The first audit revealed more flaws than I expected, which was nerve-racking. But if you're in a similar situation — **don’t panic**. It's normal, and you’ll likely go through more audits to patch things up.

The machine was running at full speed. We were in the final stretch.

## Opal in Production

They say childbirth is one of the most painful human experiences. I won’t compare directly, but launching Opal felt like a drawn-out labor with complications.

What was supposed to take hours ended up taking a full week due to last-minute issues. One integration test was producing inexplicable results. Exhaustion and stress didn’t help. We delayed the launch to debug the issue, which turned out to be a decimal misconfiguration. Not catastrophic, but enough to **shake our confidence** just hours before going live.

Still, we launched. TVL started rising, eventually hitting **$8 million—a historic high**.

## The Downside

Post-launch, Opal faced criticism. The community expected a more polished product with more features. We had delivered everything planned for V1, so I was surprised. But it may have been more about market conditions and a separate incident with MEV Capital.

MEV Capital, one of our biggest backers, had contributed ~80% of our TVL. They decided to withdraw a large amount of the protocol's liquidity without warning. Unfortunately, they encountered a bug in the DApp's slippage logic on one of the Omnipools. Without simulating the transaction or using a MEV blocker, they suffered an instant and irreversible **six-figure MEV loss**.

Tensions rose when the Opal team chose not to assume responsibility. That day, our TVL dropped significantly, and the protocol's reputation took a major hit.

It's hard to accept that the future of the protocol hinged on a small, avoidable mistake—something that could’ve been prevented in countless ways, both on our side and MEV Capital’s. All I can say is: it happened, and it cost us dearly.

## Redemption Arc

In the months that followed, we managed to rebuild some momentum. We secured a grant from Balancer, added new features, and brought TVL back to around $600K.

We're currently trying to re-energize the project with an airdrop campaign, community incentives, and feature updates.

The project still suffers from its damaged reputation, and the omnipool model has lost some steam — especially after Conic Finance started to talk about shutting down their protocol.

But we're still optimistic. Our product has been battle-tested, and we remain committed to improving and promoting it. With continued effort, Opal might just win people over again.
