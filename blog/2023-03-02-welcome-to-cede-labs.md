I’m thrilled to announce that **I’m joining Cede Labs as a Full-Stack Developer**!

<!-- truncate -->

Cede Labs is a Paris-based French startup building the missing bridge between **centralized exchanges (CEXs)** and the **decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem**. Their mission is to create seamless connectivity between Web2 and Web3 financial systems — and I’m excited to become a part of that journey.

## What Cede Labs does

At its core, Cede Labs offers a powerful Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables developers to interact with over 10 major centralized exchanges (*Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, etc.*) and more than 1,000 supported blockchains. With this SDK, developers can:

- Retrieve account and trading history
- Fetch balances
- Execute trades
- Deposit and withdraw assets

But that's not all. The team is also building a Chrome extension wallet that integrates directly with their SDK, providing a smooth and user-friendly interface. It enables users to interact with DeFi applications just like they would with a standard Web3 wallet like MetaMask — but with deeper CEX capabilities under the hood.

## Why this Role Excites Me

This opportunity marks my **official entry into the Web3 industry**, something I've been eager to pursue. Even more exciting, it allows me to continue applying my experience in **traditional finance development**, combining the best of both worlds.

The potential use cases for the SDK are vast, and the roadmap ahead is full of innovation — from enhanced trading features like **futures support** to **onboarding new exchanges**. There's a lot to build, and I'm thrilled to contribute.

## What I'll Be Working On

As a full-stack developer at Cede Labs, my role spans across both frontend and backend, including:

- Developing the Chrome extension UI and adding key features
- Contributing to the SDK, enhancing its capabilities and exchange support
- Building and maintaining a NestJS API
- Managing infrastructure deployments on AWS using Terraform

## Looking Ahead

There’s a ton of exciting work ahead, and I can’t wait to share what we’re building at Cede Labs. I’m looking forward to learning from the brilliant team and bringing my own contributions to the table. Stay tuned — more updates coming soon!
