Recently, I managed to land a position as a consultant on an FX trading desk at BNP CIB. I’ll share what I’ve learned from the experience.

# Preparing Your Resume

For this, I largely took inspiration from a well-known and widely used [guide](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/) in the tech community. While it's primarily aimed at tech candidates, I believe most of **the advice applies across all industries**. The reason this guide exists specifically for tech and not for other fields is probably because its creator had a tech background and the associated proper mindset to build it.

# Preparing for the Interview

I recommend applying after spending some time getting comfortable with problem-solving and the technologies you're targeting. Try to complete around 300 LeetCode problems — start by category, then mix them up. Prepare to write **snippets** during the interview, conduct **code reviews**, and **answer questions** about common libraries or key concepts of the language you're using. Use ChatGPT and training platforms to practice.

If you’re not in tech, there are likely equivalent themes you can prepare. For example, if you're a trader, focus on questions in **statistics, finance, and brainteasers**.

# The Recruitment Process
## Understand Who You're Talking To
The recruitment process can sometimes be long. In each interview, try to **identify your interviewer’s background** beforehand — this is crucial to **tailor your message**.

For instance, if you're speaking to a technical person, they'll expect detailed explanations of your projects. If not, they’ll want to understand the problems you solved and the impact of your work.

## Understand the Discussion Topics
What matters most is **aligning your responses** with the **interviewer’s expectations**. Their goal is to determine whether you’re motivated and the best fit for the role. Focus only on relevant experiences (the most relevant aren't always the ones you’re most proud of — they’re the ones the recruiter values the most).

When discussing your experience, **target the kinds of challenges you’d face in the job**. You can identify these by analyzing the job posting and doing your own research. This preparation is essential — without it, you might miss the point of the interview altogether. You need to be able to confidently answer:
*“Can you describe what you understand about this position?”*

For example:

> The role is that of a C++ developer at BNP CIB. The desk offering this opportunity specializes in FX trading and acts as a market maker for its clients.
>
> The missions I may be assigned if I join your team include:
>
> Supporting traders in developing tools and strategies, including specifications, implementation, and testing/backtesting. My key concerns would be robustness, scalability, and latency minimization.
>
> Another aspect involves production platforms: strategies and tools must be monitored through metrics to track their performance. I must also be responsive in case of production incidents.
>
> From a functional standpoint, the work is organized in shifts. I’d be on the European shift, meaning I’d need to be available during those hours. The role requires high focus, composure, the ability to deliver quickly, and strong communication with the teams. I understand this dynamic environment comes with high expectations, and that’s precisely the kind of challenge that motivates me—it’s exactly what I was looking for when I applied.

With this presentation, I demonstrate that I understand the **team’s domain**, I know what **tasks I’ll be responsible for** and **how they’re carried out**. I also show **awareness of the technical and human challenges**, and I tie it all back to **my motivation**.

You need to be able to deliver a presentation this clear. When you understand the role, **you understand what your recruiter wants to hear**, and you can tailor your talking points accordingly. If you’re missing information, do more research — or use the first interview to ask for it.

## Introducing Yourself

Craft a pitch to introduce yourself — practice it and learn it by heart so you can be as compelling as possible. The pitch sets the tone for the interview, so you need to **immediately prove** that you’re the right candidate. Use your understanding of the job description to structure your pitch and highlight experiences that echo the required skills.

A pitch should last about 7 minutes — long enough to say a lot, but short enough not to bore the recruiter. Use that time to talk about successful projects and show how this job is the natural next step in your journey. When discussing an experience, I recommend presenting it in this order (with some flexibility):
- the company,
- the business domain,
- your role,
- the tech stack,
- your tasks using the STAR method.

Try to sound **natural** and be **strategic** about the information you share—it should always serve your narrative. This pitch can and should **evolve** depending on who you're speaking to. The goal is for them to fully understand your background — so there’s no need to overcomplicate things with overly technical jargon.

Also prepare a follow-up to your pitch that logically connects to your motivation, based on what you’ve just said.

I can’t promise the interviewer won’t cut you off after a minute to ask a question, but know that crafting this pitch gives you a **vision**. You’ll build logical bridges between everything you’ve learned, which you can **reuse** when answering new questions. Personally, this was a key part of my prep and success in interviews.

## And Afterwards

Regardless of the outcome, remember: a rejection doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not good enough. Luck also plays a role, and you’ll likely face several rejections before improving your mindset and interview skills. Go through as many recruitment processes as possible and keep practicing!
